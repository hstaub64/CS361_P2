## OVERVIEW:
This project is an implementation of a Nondeterministic Finite automata in Java,
where NFAs can be instantiated as a class and given a defined 5-tuple of language,
states, start state, final states, and transitions. The NFA can read strings and
determine if they would be accepted, or the max copies the machine will produce at
once while operating on a string.

## COMPILING AND RUNNING:
Give the command for compiling the program, the command
for running the program, and any usage instructions the
user needs.
These are command-line instructions for a system like onyx.
They have nothing to do with Eclipse or any other IDE. They
must be specific - assume the user has Java installed, but
has no idea how to compile or run a Java program from the
command-line.
e.g.
From the directory containing all source files, compile the
driver class (and all dependencies) with the command:
$ javac Class1.java
Run the compiled class file with the command:
$ java Class1
Console output will give the results after the program finishes.
## PROGRAM DESIGN AND IMPORTANT CONCEPTS:
This is the sort of information someone who really wants to
understand your program - possibly to make future enhancements -
would want to know.
Explain the main concepts and organization of your program so that
the reader can understand how your program works. This is not a repeat
of javadoc comments or an exhaustive listing of all methods, but an
explanation of the critical algorithms and object interactions that make
up the program.
Explain the main responsibilities of the classes and interfaces that make
up the program. Explain how the classes work together to achieve the
program
goals. If there are critical algorithms that a user should understand,
explain them as well.
If you were responsible for designing the program's classes and choosing
how they work together, why did you design the program this way? What, if
anything, could be improved?
## TESTING:
How did you test your program to be sure it works and meets all of the
requirements? What was the testing strategy? What kinds of tests were
run?
Can your program handle bad input? Is your program idiot-proof? How do
you
know? What are the known issues / bugs remaining in your program?
## DISCUSSION:
Discuss the issues you encountered during programming (development)
and testing. What problems did you have? What did you have to research
and learn on your own? What kinds of errors did you get? How did you
fix them?
What parts of the project did you find challenging? Is there anything
that finally "clicked" for you in the process of working on this project?

Used to understand the "computeifabsent" command on hash lists, which I used to procedurally
add elements to NFAState's transition table as needed.
